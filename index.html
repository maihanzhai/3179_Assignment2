        <strong style="font-size:25px">E</strong>ducation is a purposeful activity. It can spread knowledge or develop
        skills. At the same time, we can shape a better society through education to understand and respect rights, laws
        and regulations. In short, for every country, education is a top priority. Every country and the United Nations
        are working together to improve the quality and efficiency of education.

    <h2 align="center" , style="font-family:sans-serif">Literacy Rates in Different Countries</h2>

    <p style="font-family:sans-serif">
        This map shows the literacy rate of each country at different times.
    </p>

    <p>
        Among these countries, we can find that the majority of the world's countries have literacy rates above 50%.
        According to the map, there are still some countries in the <font color="red"><b>African</b></font> region where
        the literacy rate is around 30%.
    </p>

    <p>
        Of these countries, in the <b>2000</b>, <b>Finland's</b> national literacy rate reached 100%. <b>Greenland</b>
        had a 100% literacy rate in <b>2001</b>. <b>Norway</b>, on the other hand, had a 100% literacy rate by
        <b>2011</b>.

    <h2 align="center" , style="font-family:sans-serif">Literacy and Illiteracy Rates in The World in Different Years
    </h2>

    <p style="font-family:sans-serif">
        According to my search on the Internet, the earliest literacy in the form of books appeared around <font
            color="red"><b>3,500-3,000
                BC</b></font>. But literacy was still limited by many things. It was not until the Middle Ages that
        people gradually had the opportunity to become literate because of the mass production of books.
    </p>

    <p style="font-family:sans-serif">
        This line graph shows the change in the world's illiteracy and literacy rates between 1800 and 2016.
    </p>

    <p style="font-family:sans-serif">
        According to the change of the line cahrt, we can see that the literacy rate has been <b>increasing</b>.
        However, the growth was relatively slow until 1930. It grew very quickly around 1930 because at that time,
        education was highly regarded by people.

        The four donut charts are created from the above line chart. They show the percentage of literacy and illiteracy
        rates in the world for four different periods: <b>1820</b>, <b>1900</b>, <b>1950</b>, and <b>2000</b>.
    </p>

    <p>The orange part inside the donut chart represents the world literacy population. Comparing these four donut
        charts, we can clearly see that the <b>
            <font color=orange>orange</font>
        </b> part has become more and more weighted as time goes on. This means that more and more people in the world
        are becoming literate.

        This bar chart represents the percentage of elementary school repeaters in different countries. The country of
        <b>Burundi</b> has the highest elementary school repetition rate of all the study subjects, with 24.25%. Which
        means that this country's education level is relatively backward.
